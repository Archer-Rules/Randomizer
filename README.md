Hey Y'all!

This is my first real solo project, and it'll obviously show. Any suggestions or feedback is greatly appreciated! 

I haven't quite figured out a good way to code many of the fallback and whatnot that you would see in other programs here yet, so please enter only what is asked in the descriptions.
Eventually I hope on adding a more interactable GUI, as well as a full randomizer with weighting options and other custom configs, but I'm not getting too overzealous yet.

Thanks for checking it out.
